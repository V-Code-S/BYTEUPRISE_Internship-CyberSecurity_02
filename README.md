# BYTEUPRISE_Internship-CyberSecurity_02
The goal of this project is to create a basic keylogger program in Python that records and logs keystrokes. The program will capture every key press made by the user and save these keystrokes to a file. This project is intended for educational purposes only, to understand how keylogging works and the ethical considerations surrounding its use.
