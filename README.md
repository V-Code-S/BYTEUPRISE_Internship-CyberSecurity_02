# Simple Keylogger
The goal of this project is to create a basic keylogger program in Python that records and logs keystrokes. The program will capture every key press made by the user and save these keystrokes to a file. This project is intended for educational purposes only, to understand how keylogging works and the ethical considerations surrounding its use.
Explanation of the Project
A keylogger is a type of surveillance software that has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log file. These log files can then be used to monitor activities on a computer.

## Key Components of the Project
Keystroke Logging:

Capturing each key press.
Logging the captured keystrokes to a file.
Ethical Considerations:

Always inform and get consent from users before deploying a keylogger.
Use it for ethical and educational purposes only.
