# Simple Keylogger
The goal of this project is to create a basic keylogger program in Python that records and logs keystrokes. The program will capture every key press made by the user and save these keystrokes to a file. This project is intended for educational purposes only, to understand how keylogging works and the ethical considerations surrounding its use.
Explanation of the Project
A keylogger is a type of surveillance software that has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log file. These log files can then be used to monitor activities on a computer.

## Key Components of the Project
Keystroke Logging:

### Capturing each key press.
Logging the captured keystrokes to a file.

### Ethical Considerations:
Always inform and get consent from users before deploying a keylogger.
Use it for ethical and educational purposes only.

## Explanation of the Project
A keylogger is a type of surveillance software that has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log file. These log files can then be used to monitor activities on a computer.

## Keystroke Logging:
The Keylogger class uses pynput to capture keystrokes.
The on_press method captures each keystroke and appends it to the log.
The start method starts the keylogger, and the stop method stops it.
The save_log method saves the recorded keystrokes to a file.

## User Interface (Optional):
A simple GUI is created using tkinter.
The GUI has buttons to start and stop the keylogger, enabling the user to control the logging process easily.

## Ethical Considerations
### Transparency and Consent: Always inform users and get their consent before deploying a keylogger.
### Purpose: Use the keylogger for ethical and educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.
### Privacy: Respect the privacy of individuals and use keyloggers in controlled environments with clear, ethical guidelines.
This project demonstrates the basic working of a keylogger and emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in its use.
